## Data Analysis & Insights
Write a short analysis of your findings. Include at least one interesting insight from your data.

We found that overall, students who had a sympathy level of 2 were both the most trustworthy and had the least gusto. We also found that those who had a sympathy level of 7, 8, or 9 had a similar level of trustworthiness.

## Reflection
Answer briefly:
- What went well in your project? In general, just about everything went well. The older data anlysis assignment provide the necessary code for finishing this project, so I was able to get the project done quickly.
- What was the most challenging part? Probably the hardest part of this was deciding which charts to do, as well as transferring the data from the google from into the csv.
- If you had more time, what would you do differently? If I had more time, I would likely try to get an actual survey out instead of a joke one (or maybe get more responses, I'm not sure which one, maybe both)
